      "My son enjoys playing with the train, but I have to say, the tracks don’t always stay connected when he pushes the train around too quickly. It can be a bit frustrating. It’s a good toy, but it might be better suited for gentle play or older kids.",

      "Bought this as a birthday gift for my nephew, and he loves it! The train set is bright and engaging, and it came in nice packaging, so it felt very special. It’s also safe, with rounded edges on the tracks and no small parts, which I appreciate. Great purchase!",
