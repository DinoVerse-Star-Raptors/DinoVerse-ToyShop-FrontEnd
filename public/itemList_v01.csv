We can help our children understand this and the importance of reducing food waste with the Wonky Fruit &amp; Vegetables set. Even if a piece of produce looks funky, it’s still worth saving and using instead of throwing away. This playset also helps enhance fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. It includes a pretend knife and 5 sliceable pieces of produce: an apple, pear, carrot, tomato and cucumber.</p><ul>
<li>Teaching children that wonky and imperfect looking fruits and vegetables are just as good as others</li>
<li>Aims to reduce food waste by teaching children through visibility of imperfect produce that it should not be thrown out</li>
<li>This set includes a pretend play knife and 5 sliceable fruits and vegetables.</li>
